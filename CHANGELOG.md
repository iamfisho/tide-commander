- **README resume section** - Added documentation for resuming agent sessions

## [0.77.0] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- **Scene2D static/dynamic layer split** - Ground, grid, areas, and buildings render to an off-screen canvas cache that only redraws on camera or data changes; main canvas blits the cache in a single `drawImage` call
- **Adaptive FPS throttling** - Idle scenes render at 8 fps, working-agent scenes at 15 fps, and active interactions (pan/zoom/drag) run uncapped, cutting GPU usage when nothing is moving
- **DPR cap and pixel budget** - Device pixel ratio clamped to 1.25 with a 4M-pixel ceiling to keep `clearRect`/fill passes fast on ultra-wide and HiDPI displays
- **Frustum culling** - Agents, areas, buildings, and boss-subordinate lines skip drawing when off-screen
- **Removed all Canvas2D `shadowBlur`** - Replaced with lightweight offset shapes, wider translucent strokes, and radial gradients across `AgentRenderer`, `AreaRenderer`, `BuildingRenderer`, and `Scene2DEffects`
- **Removed all CSS `backdrop-filter: blur()`** - Agent bar, bottom toolbar, context menu, commander view overlay, guake terminal, and right panel now use higher-opacity backgrounds instead
- **Color conversion caching** - `hexToRgba`, `lightenColor`, and `darkenColor` results cached in shared maps with quantized alpha keys
- **Cached sorted area arrays** - Area sort by zIndex computed once and invalidated on mutation instead of re-sorting every frame
- **Per-frame store snapshots in AgentRenderer** - `beginFrame()` reads `customAgentClasses` and `agentsWithUnseenOutput` once, avoiding `store.getState()` per agent in the hot loop
- **Cached ground gradient in GridRenderer** - Radial gradient rebuilt only on viewport resize instead of every frame
- **Removed animated dash offsets** - Area borders, boss lines, and drawing previews use static dash patterns instead of per-frame `lineDashOffset` animation
- **Reduced working-agent animation complexity** - Removed water-wave ripple effect; simplified bounce, pulse, and selection glow to fewer trig calls
- **Granular store selectors** - New `useAgents`, `useAreas`, `useBuildings`, `useFileChanges` selectors replace broad state subscriptions
- **Memo-wrapped VirtualizedOutputList** - Wrapped in `React.memo` with custom comparator to skip re-renders when messages haven't changed

### Fixed
- **Memory leak in useSceneSetup cleanup** - StrictMode disposal now checks `store.viewMode` instead of `canvas.isConnected`, correctly preserving WebGL context during React re-mounts
- **Stale eslint disable comment** - Removed orphaned `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppression in `useSpotlightSearch` (rule was not configured)

## [0.76.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Isolated ElapsedTimer in AgentPanel** - Extracted elapsed timer + stop button into its own `memo`-wrapped component so the parent `AgentPanel` no longer re-renders every second while an agent is working
- **Agent status label badge** - Colored status label (working/idle/error/offline) shown in the agent panel header for at-a-glance state
- **Animated mobile accordion** - Focused panel expands with `panelExpand` keyframe animation plus staggered `contentFadeIn` and `inputSlideIn` for smooth open/close transitions
- **Focus toggle** - Tapping an already-focused agent header collapses it back (toggle behavior instead of one-way)

### Changed
- **Exec task output preview** - Collapsed exec output now shows last 6 lines instead of 3 for better context
- **Mobile auto-focus skips touch devices** - `(pointer: coarse)` media query prevents auto-focusing inputs on mobile, avoiding unwanted virtual keyboard popup
- **Pin to bottom on focus** - Scroll auto-pins when an agent panel becomes focused (not just expanded)
- **Click handler optimization** - Panel body `onClick` only fires on non-focused panels; focused panels route header clicks to toggle

### Removed
- **WorkingIndicator in AgentPanel** - Replaced by the isolated `ElapsedTimer` component that uses the Guake stop bar styling
- **`.agent-panel-typing` / `.agent-panel-stop-btn`** - Removed old typing indicator styles in favor of shared `guake-stop-bar` styles

## [0.75.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **AskUserQuestion inline renderer** - New `AskQuestionInput` component renders questions with numbered options, badges, description text, and expandable markdown previews directly in the output panel
- **Mobile card-stack Commander View** - Replaced scroll-based layout with Apple Wallet-style card stack: focused agent fills the screen, non-focused agents collapse to peeking headers with tap-to-focus

### Changed
- **WebSocket broadcast serialization** - Extracted `messageReplacer` and `serializeMessage` to serialize once and reuse the string for all clients, eliminating per-client re-serialization and double-parse validation
- **Combined status polling** - Merged separate status sync (30s) and orphan polling (10s) intervals into a single 20s timer, reducing timer overhead
- **Async session stat** - `getSessionActivityStatus` now uses `fs.promises.stat` instead of blocking `fs.statSync`

## [0.74.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Atomic file writes with backup recovery** - All data persistence (agents, areas, buildings, skills, secrets, etc.) now uses write-to-tmp + rename pattern with `.bak` fallback, preventing corruption from mid-write crashes
- **Async debounced agent persistence** - `updateAgent()` coalesces rapid writes into a single async write (2s debounce), reducing I/O pressure from frequent status updates
- **Flush-on-shutdown** - New `flushPersistAgents()` cancels any pending debounced write and performs an immediate sync save during graceful shutdown
- **Removed unnecessary memo wrappers** - `VirtualizedOutputList` and `AgentPanel` no longer wrapped in `React.memo()` since they re-render on every parent update anyway
- **2D scene animation timing** - Separate `animationDelta` based on time since last render keeps animation speed constant regardless of FPS limiting

### Added
- **Mobile Commander View** - Fully responsive layout for screens under 768px: vertically scrolling 60vh agent cards with scroll-snap, touch-optimized 44px hit targets, compact header/tabs/filters, horizontally scrollable filter bar, and safe-area inset support for notched devices
- **Virtualizer initialRect** - Prevents empty first render by providing a non-zero initial size estimate
- **ResizeObserver scroll sync** - Dispatches a scroll event after container resize to keep the virtualizer offset in sync with the actual scrollTop after CSS grid reflows

### Fixed
- **Virtualizer blank on first render** - `initialRect: { width: 500, height: 800 }` prevents `outerSize=0` from yielding zero visible items until a scroll event
- **Virtualizer blank after filter change** - ResizeObserver detects container resize and forces virtualizer to re-read scroll offset, fixing zero-item renders after grid reflow

## [0.73.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Memo-wrapped core components** - `AgentBar`, `GuakeOutputPanel`, `TerminalHeader`, `TerminalInputArea`, `AgentPanel`, `MobileFabMenu`, `GuakeAgentLink`, and `ThemeSelector` are now wrapped in `React.memo()` to skip re-renders when props are unchanged
- **Isolated ElapsedTimer component** - Extracted the 1-second elapsed timer into its own component so the entire `TerminalInputArea` no longer re-renders every tick
- **Stable callback references** - Replaced inline arrow functions with `useCallback` and ref-based patterns across `App.tsx`, `AgentBar`, and `CommanderView` keyboard handlers to preserve referential equality
- **Narrower store selectors** - New `useAgentCount`, `useSupervisorLastReport`, `useSupervisorGeneratingReport`, `useSubagentsMapForAgent`, and `useLastPrompt` selectors replace broad subscriptions
- **Set immutability for selectedAgentIds** - All mutations now create new `Set()` instances so shallow-equality selectors properly detect changes
- **Commander View tab counts** - Pre-computed `tabCounts` map replaces inline `Array.from().filter()` on every render
- **Working agent panel styling** - Changed from purple to green theme for better visual distinction
- **Agent removal cleanup** - `handleRemoveAgent` now stops the runtime, cancels pending permissions, and cleans up boss hierarchy before deleting

### Added
- **`AgentBarItem` memoized component** - Individual agent items in the bottom bar are now independently memoized, preventing full-bar re-renders on single-agent updates
- **`usePermissionRequests` reactive selector** - Permission requests in `GuakeOutputPanel` now use a store subscription instead of imperative reads, ensuring new permissions appear immediately
- **Agent-switch scroll reset** - `isAgentSwitching` state + `key={activeAgentId}` on `VirtualizedOutputList` forces a clean remount, fixing stale virtualizer offsets when switching agents

### Fixed
- **Stale closure in delete handler** - `handleDeleteSelectedAgents` now reads selection from `store.getState()` at execution time instead of a potentially stale closure
- **Console log cleanup** - Removed ~40 debug `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.trace` calls left over from development

## [0.72.1] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Non-blocking WebSocket connection** - Connection handler no longer awaits `syncAllAgentStatus()` before sending initial state; sends custom classes, agents, and settings immediately, then syncs status in background with a follow-up `agents_update`

## [0.72.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Granular store selectors** - App and AgentBar no longer subscribe to the entire store via `useStore()`; each slice (agents, areas, buildings, settings, etc.) uses its own selector, drastically reducing unnecessary re-renders
- **History cache for instant agent switching** - Per-agent history cache shows cached messages immediately on revisit instead of blanking the screen while fetching
- **Commander View virtualized output** - AgentPanel now uses `VirtualizedOutputList` instead of rendering every message in the DOM, improving scroll performance for long histories
- **Disabled performance.mark/measure** - Native `PerformanceMeasure` entries accumulated indefinitely causing ~40MB+ memory leak in long sessions; disabled to prevent bloat

### Added
- **`/clear` command in Commander View** - Typing `/clear` in an agent panel input now clears that agent's context and history
- **`useRenderCounter` dev hook** - Logs render frequency per component interval to help spot render storms during development
- **`useLastSelectedAgentId` selector** - Fine-grained selector that only triggers re-renders when the last-selected agent ID changes
- **Escape key fix in Commander View** - Escape no longer closes Commander View when a file viewer or context modal is open on top

### Fixed
- **Space key in collapsed terminal input** - Space shortcut to open terminal now properly blurs the input first in both 3D and 2D scene handlers
- **History fade-in flash** - Skip hiding content when switching agents if cached history is available, preventing a blank flash on revisit

## [0.71.5] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Faster history fade-in** - Reduced terminal history message fade-in animation from 250ms (with 50ms delay) to 50ms immediate for snappier feel

## [0.71.4] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **README** - Added Commander View screenshot, updated view modes count from three to four, trailing whitespace cleanup

## [0.71.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **Area logo hash in 3D sync** - Include logo opacity, dimensions, position, and filename in area hash so 3D scene re-renders when logo properties change
- **Logo texture race condition** - Logo texture load callback now fetches the current area group and state from the store instead of using stale closure references
- **Logo opacity stacking** - Enabled `depthWrite` and `alphaTest` on logo material and set `renderOrder: -1` to prevent fill opacity stacking through the logo
- **Brightness skips logos** - `setBrightness` and `setSelectedArea` now skip `areaLogo` meshes so logo opacity is not affected by brightness changes

## [0.71.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **Duplicate native notifications** - Skip `showNotification` on native Android since the foreground service WebSocket already handles background notifications, preventing double alerts
- **Notification listener cleanup** - `initNotificationListeners` now returns a cleanup function and guards against duplicate registration across React re-renders
- **Listener memory leak** - WebSocket connection hook properly removes notification tap listeners on unmount

## [0.71.1] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **Custom app icon** - Replaced default Android launcher icons (all densities) with Tide Commander branded icon and dark background (#0a0a0f)
- **Proper Capacitor ES imports** - Switched from `require()` try/catch to direct ES module imports for `@capacitor/core` and `@capacitor/local-notifications`
- **ServerConfig plugin via registerPlugin** - Use Capacitor `registerPlugin()` API instead of accessing `Capacitor.Plugins` directly for type-safe native bridge calls
- **Keyboard adjustResize** - Added `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` to AndroidManifest for proper keyboard handling
- **Notification error handling** - Wrapped all LocalNotifications calls in try/catch with console logging for better debugging on native
- **Notification ID range** - Shifted local notification IDs to start at 100 to avoid collision with foreground service notification (ID 1)
- **Removed scheduled delay** - Notifications now fire immediately instead of using 100ms `schedule.at` delay
- **Live reload dev config** - Added dev server URL to `capacitor.config.ts` for faster Android development iteration

### Removed
- **Deleted vector drawable icons** - Removed `ic_launcher_foreground.xml` and `ic_launcher_background.xml` in favor of raster PNG icons

## [0.71.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Native Android background notifications** - Foreground service now maintains its own OkHttp WebSocket connection to deliver agent notifications as Android system notifications when app is in background
- **ServerConfigPlugin** - New Capacitor plugin that syncs server URL and auth token from JS to native SharedPreferences for foreground service WebSocket
- **App foreground/background tracking** - MainActivity tracks `isAppInForeground` state so native notifications only fire when WebView JS is paused

### Changed
- **WebSocket foreground service rewrite** - Refactored `WebSocketForegroundService` with native OkHttp WebSocket client, exponential backoff reconnect, and dynamic foreground notification status updates
- **Capacitor dependency cleanup** - Removed unused `@capacitor/haptics` and `@capawesome/capacitor-background-task` plugins from Android build
- **Notification imports separated** - Split Capacitor core and local-notifications imports into separate try/catch blocks for better web build compatibility
- **Mobile message padding** - Increased bottom padding in mobile terminal output to account for context bar, stop bar, and input wrapper height

- **Locale updates** - Added area logo and multi-query translations across all 11 locales

## [0.69.4] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Subagent JSONL streaming** - Real-time streaming of subagent activity from JSONL files via file watcher, with inline stream panel showing tool use, text output, and results as they happen
- **Pull conflict resolution flow** - Git pull now detects merge conflicts and routes them through the existing merge resolution UI instead of showing a generic error

### Changed
- **Subagent auto-remove timer** - Extracted into shared `scheduleRemove` function; incoming stream entries now extend the timer so subagents with late-arriving data stay visible longer
- **Folder dropdown polish** - Tighter padding/spacing, smaller font sizes, smooth scroll with `onWheel`, and redundant path label hidden when it matches the folder name
- **Dedup debug logging** - History and live output deduplication now logs dropped outputs with UUIDs/timestamps for easier troubleshooting

### Fixed
- **Pull uses `--no-rebase`** - Git pull endpoint now uses merge strategy by default, and properly parses conflict file paths from combined stdout+stderr
- **Pull return type** - `pullFromRemote` now returns `MergeResult` (with `conflicts` array) instead of generic `GitBranchOperationResult`

## [0.69.3] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Expandable subagent results** - Subagent completion messages now show a collapsible "Show result" toggle instead of inline preview text, keeping the output clean while preserving full result access
- **Hide tool_result in simple view** - Tool result entries are now hidden in simple/history view to match live output filtering behavior

### Removed
- **Dead silent context refresh code** - Removed unused `scheduleSilentContextRefresh` function and its wiring in runtime-events/runtime-service (context tracking now uses `usage_snapshot` events exclusively)

## [0.69.2] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Simplified Claude context tracking** - `step_complete` for Claude agents now preserves the authoritative `usage_snapshot` value instead of re-deriving context from potentially cumulative modelUsage/token sums; eliminates inflated context bar readings
- **Subagent event isolation** - `usage_snapshot` and `step_complete` events with `parentToolUseId` are now skipped for context tracking, preventing subagent token counts from corrupting the parent agent's context bar; subagent cost is still accumulated into `tokensUsed`
- **Subagent context_update broadcast filter** - `runtime-listeners` skips broadcasting `context_update` for subagent events to prevent UI flicker
- **Mobile sidebar close button** - Redesigned as a sticky header bar pinned to the top of the sidebar instead of a small floating circle
- **Mobile sidebar backdrop** - Darker overlay (0.7 opacity) with stronger blur (4px) and `touch-action: none` to prevent scroll-through
- **Mobile agent list** - Touch-friendly sizing with 44px min-height tap targets, larger icons, and active-state feedback
- **Mobile tool history** - Added dedicated mobile styles for tool history panel (compact headers, items, and expandable details)
- **Mobile unit panel** - Horizontal stat rows, compact secondary info sections, hidden 3D model preview to save vertical space
- **Small mobile refinements** - Tighter sidebar close button, wrapping action icons, smaller agent list items for screens under 380px

### Fixed
- **Unit panel button tap delay** - Added `touch-action: manipulation` and `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` to eliminate 300ms tap delay on mobile

## [0.69.1] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Mobile context bar** - Compact context stats bar above the input area on mobile, tappable to open the full context modal
- **New backend tests** - Tests for comma-separated token counts and visual context format parsing

### Changed
- **Unified token parser** - `parseContextOutput` and `parseVisualContextOutput` now share a robust `parseTokenValue` helper supporting `k`, `m` suffixes, comma separators, and decimal percentages
- **Cumulative token guard** - `usage_snapshot` and `step_complete` handlers detect when token sums exceed the context limit (cumulative session totals) and preserve the last valid per-request value instead of inflating the context bar
- **Context stats broadcast sanitization** - `broadcastContextStats` resets totalTokens to 0 if it exceeds contextWindow, preventing impossible context bar values
- **Context command fallback chain** - `handleRequestContextStats` now tries CLI fetch, then in-session `/context` command, then tracked data (was: CLI then tracked data only)
- **Context stats from tracked data** - `buildStatsFromTrackedData` guards against values exceeding contextLimit
- **Real-time context updates** - `updateAgentContext` now also patches `contextStats` (totalTokens, contextWindow, usedPercent) so the context modal stays in sync
- **History view** - Shows all messages including utility slash commands (`/context`, `/cost`, `/compact`) and tool results in simple view
- **Visual context parser** - Upgraded regex to handle comma-separated numbers, `m` suffix (millions), and decimal percentages
- **Context stats parsing** - `runtime-listeners` now tries `parseAllFormats` (which handles visual bar-chart format) before falling back to `parseContextOutput`

### Fixed
- **Sidebar toggle on mobile** - Button now toggles the slide-in sidebar on mobile instead of the desktop collapse state
- **Sidebar open state on mobile** - `!important` overrides on transform/opacity/pointer-events ensure the sidebar actually appears when opened
- **Mobile agent bar height** - Uses CSS custom property with `safe-area-inset-bottom` for landscape and portrait modes
- **Stop bar position on mobile** - Moved up to clear the context bar
- **Session expanded state** - Moved `useState` for session continuation before early returns to fix React hook ordering
- **File path paste** - Inserts path as text when file is not found instead of silently dropping it
- **dist-app in .gitignore** - Added `dist-app/` to prevent build artifacts from being tracked

## [0.69.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Subagent observability** - Inline activity panels below Task tool lines show real-time tool usage, elapsed time, and completion stats for subagents
- **Real-time context tracking** - Context bar updates live during streaming via `usage_snapshot` events instead of waiting for step completion or `/context` command
- **Lightweight `context_update` WebSocket message** - New message type for efficient real-time context bar updates
- **Subagent activity tracking** - New `addSubagentActivity` and `updateSubagentStats` store actions with tool activity timeline UI
